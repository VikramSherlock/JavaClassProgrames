// The Output is 10
//In the above code, of Main method portion we have 
//2 Non-static variables of int and float data type.
//Within that we have assigned int a value as 10 and the 
//same values we initialized to float f1. As Both int and float are
//related to Corresponding Data type type casting is possible . 
//As we need to print the f1 value which of int datatype compiler 
//would perform type casting and gives the Output as 10.0 bcaz f1 is float data type.
