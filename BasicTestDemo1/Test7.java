// cannot convert from int to boolean
//In the above code, of Main method portion we have  
//2 Non-static variables of int and boolean data type./ 
//Within that we have assigned int a value as 10 and the 
//same values we initialized to boolean b1. 
//As Both int andboolean ARE NOT related to Corresponding
//Data type type casting is impossible.
//And compiler wouldn't convert the int value to boolean bcaz
//it would be a inappropriate operation as per the JAVA and 	Mathematical wise .
